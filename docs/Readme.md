# Habilis
A modern IDE for modern data

## The Problem


There has been substantial development of languages, libraries, and frameworks for data mining and analsysis 
within the past decade. Despite this, growth current editors IDEs are stuck in the nd software for interfacing with data are

e IDEs and toolsets designed Current data analysis tools are not suited to handle modern data.

- Exponential increase in both size, dissemination, and heterogeneity of data.
- Exponential increase in breadth and complexity of algorithms/methods for
  mining, processing and learning from said data.
- Pace of development exceeds an individual's ability to 
- Development environments and human-facing tools do not adequately 
  - Incidental complexity

## The Solution

- Reduce *incidental complexity* through reusable patterns
- Visual/Reactive


## Why?

- Agnostic to format of the data
  - Tabular
  - Relational/
  - Text
- Agnostic to location of the data
- Capability to interface with data in different locations
- Serverless model
- Immutable

## Principles


- Transparency: Minimal separation between representation
- Knowledge Discovery: Minimal separation between representation
- Immutability:
- Agnostic to Where the Data Resides
- Separation between state and behavior
- Repeatability / Communicability
- Expose patterns

## 
- Shorten the feedback loop between action and result
  - "Insta-Repl": Close relationship between
  - See immediate effects of change

## A more concrete step

Pipeline:
- A sequence of discrete transformations which act on data.
- Each step of the transformation, or node, can act as an independent
  unit


### Applications

- Querying
- Mining/Discovery
- Representation (BI)


# Current Landscape

# Editors
  - Jupyter
  - Spyder
  - RStudio


- One or two decades behind
